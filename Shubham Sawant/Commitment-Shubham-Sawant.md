## Commitment facilitates empiricism and collaborative teamwork.

* When we commit to the success of the team, not just caring about our individual achievements, that creates an environment of trust, productive problem solving, and high team standards.

* When we commit to doing Scrum fully, not just picking and choosing the easy parts, we can fully experience the benefits of transparency, inspection, and adaptation.

* Commitment is about dedication to doing our best.  

* When we commit to delivering value, we feel a greater sense of shared purpose that drives our motivation to collaborate.
