# Courage
_______________________________________________________________________________
From the agile values considered for this particular project, courage is the one which significantly increases efficiency, and helps to solve blockers at the very beginning. Being a team project it is important that there is quality participation of each member, which requires expressing ideas without hesitation.

### Courage shown in Week 1
______________________________________________________________________________
The first week meeting was completely on fixation of a concrete idea , architecture and the technology being used.***One of the member decided to divide the topics(Technology) between ourselves*** , and research on the compatibility with Golang.***A 3 day window was also imposed*** to ensure speedy and efficient output. Each member had to update a readme.md on the repository ensuring enough information is available to ensure minimal blockages due  to lack of resources/research in near future during the development stage.


### Courage shown in Week 2
______________________________________________________________________________
The research done in previous meeting was evaluated, being a 6 six member team it was important to distribute the work equally amongst each other. Implementation of 6 APIs became necessary , so each member works on a single one. During the discussion over the identification of APIs there was one observation made , an API for login was decided upon , ensuring user sessions and generation of group ID, later an idea was the idea was scrapped due to unnecessary overhead.
***In the same week another meeting was held , wherein login API was considered again by a suggestion of team member which was implemented.***

### Courage shown in Week 3
______________________________________________________________________________
The previously done work was evaluated , there were some issues with the review api, a decision had to be made whether to keep it as a specific product or generic, so courage was shown by considering the former idea. Whilest developing the Cart API so I showed courage by explaining a blocker I was experiencing, could not figure out put route.The redis integration was decided as it was my part, which was tested using redis on docker. The challenge was to integrate redis in such a way that if no data is present in redis, mongo should be hit. Courage was shown by accepting the challenge.
### Courage shown in Week 4
______________________________________________________________________________
There was a challenge faced as to decide whether the network should have been setup in private or public, being somewhat difficult yet private was chosen.Another issue was considering multiple regions to setup the network,courage was shown by me by taking initiative and trying to setup up the network and create a file for the steps.
