# Feedback:

"Feedback is a critical ingredient of continuous improvement and without it, little or no learning would take place in the organisation. Organisations improve through effective feedback. Frequent feedback is vital for Agile development teams to understand whether the team is going in the direction as expected. The software is delivered early to the customer and a feedback is taken so that necessary changes can be made if needed. Concrete feedback about the current state of the system is priceless."
