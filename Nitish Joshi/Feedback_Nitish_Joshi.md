# Feedback:

"Feedback is a critical ingredient of continuous improvement and without it, little or no learning would take place in the organisation. Organisations improve through effective feedback. Frequent feedback is vital for Agile development teams to understand whether the team is going in the direction as expected. The software is delivered early to the customer and a feedback is taken so that necessary changes can be made if needed. Concrete feedback about the current state of the system is priceless."

## Week 1:
* Team decided to regularly provide feedbacks to each other in order gain a different perspective.
* Team decided to keep a 5 minute feedback session at the end of each meeting.
* One of the team member provided feedback on the use of the Kanban flow diagram and the scrum task board.
