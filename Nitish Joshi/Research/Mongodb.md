# What is MongoDB?  
MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need.  

## About:
* MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time.
* The document model maps to the objects in your application code, making data easy to work with.
* Ad hoc queries, indexing, and real time aggregation provide powerful ways to access and analyze your data.
* MongoDB is a distributed database at its core, so high availability, horizontal scaling, and geographic distribution are built in and easy to use.
* MongoDB is free and open-source.

## Makes development easy
MongoDBâ€™s document model is simple for developers to learn and use, while still providing all the capabilities needed to meet the most complex requirements at any scale. 

## Features:
* High availability through built-in replication and failover
* Horizontal scalability with native sharding
* End-to-end security
* Native document validation and schema exploration with Compass
* Always available global support
* Management tooling for automation, monitoring, and backup
