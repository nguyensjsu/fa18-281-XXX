# AWS Lambda
    AWS Lambda is an event-driven, serverless computing platform. It belongs to a computing service in Amazon. The use of Lambda is to build smaller, on-demand applications that are responsive to events and new information. Benefits using Lambda are we don't need to worry about server config, pay only what you use. An example using AWS Lambda is to resize and update thumbnails. 

    Question: 
    need more time to investigate how it can apply to our project
